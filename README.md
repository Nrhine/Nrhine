    - Hello, how are you? I'm Nico üëã

## About Me

I am a lifelong learner with a diverse background and a passion for technology, foreign languages, and problem-solving. My journey began in high school as a part-time employee at Best Buy, where I first developed my interest in technology and development. Later, when I started my undergraduate career at Ohio University, I initially majored in computer science but switched to political science during freshman orientation. Despite this change, I continued exploring technology in my free time.

After graduating in 2020, I began working in the quality department of a medical device company, where I managed several large internal databases and ensured compliance with local and international regulations. While rewarding, the role wasn‚Äôt as fulfilling as I had hoped. In the summer of 2024, I rediscovered my passion for coding and programming, which led me to enroll in a Software Engineering bootcamp at BrainStation. There, I began developing a custom POS and inventory system for a local start-up, leveraging JavaScript, MySQL, and Agile methodologies. This system is set to launch in early 2025.

Beyond my professional journey, I am passionate about traveling, reading, movies, rock climbing, and studying foreign languages. These interests have inspired me to live in several countries and states, broadening my understanding of myself, others, and various cultures. I aim to combine my love for programming and personal passions to create solutions that positively impact the world around me.

## Education

I recently graduated with a Diploma in Software Engineering from BrainStation. For my capstone project, I began developing a custom POS and inventory system for a start-up business in the Columbus, OH area. Designed to be an all-in-one solution for their daily business needs, this scalable application leverages React, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and Agile methodologies. Set to launch in 2025, it will securely process transactions, generate tailored business performance reports, automatically update inventory levels, and send alerts when stock is running low, enhancing operational efficiency.

After completing the BrainStation bootcamp, I began working as a freelance developer while actively seeking a full-time position. Through freelancing, I continue to refine my skills and deliver impactful solutions while seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and dynamic teams.

Prior to BrainStation, I studied International Studies and Political Science, with a minor in Anthropology, at Ohio University. This academic foundation honed my critical thinking and communication skills, which I now apply to problem-solving in tech.

## What I'm Learning

I am actively expanding my skill set by exploring new technologies and certifications to complement my existing expertise:

- Python: Learning through FreeCodeCamp to deepen my understanding of versatile scripting and data-focused programming.
- Java: Studying through a Udemy course to strengthen my knowledge of object-oriented programming and backend development.
- AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification: Preparing for certification to gain a foundational understanding of cloud computing and AWS services.

## Projects

- **Amazon Customer Reviews Enhancement Project:** During a 24-hour innovation sprint, our cross-functional team of eight took on the challenge of improving the quality and authenticity of Amazon‚Äôs customer reviews while addressing issues like spam and manipulation. Leveraging technologies like React.js, Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, and SASS, we developed an interactive dashboard featuring AI-driven keyword analysis, advanced filtering options, and an improved review submission process to encourage detailed, authentic feedback. My role focused on crafting an intuitive, user-friendly interface and contributing to strategies for ensuring data integrity and review authenticity. Working collaboratively under Agile methodologies, we delivered a fully functional prototype and comprehensive proposal, demonstrating our ability to solve complex e-commerce challenges under tight deadlines.
